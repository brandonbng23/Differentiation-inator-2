## Project Development

Differentiation-inator 2.0 is a personal project. It is modeled off a Differentiation-inator, which was created as a project to fulfil a course requirment. The requirments of the aforementioned course project limited Differentiation-inator. Differentiation-inator 2.0 is being programmed without being held to these requirements in order to deliver a conveinient, simple web application that can be used to find a function's derivative.
