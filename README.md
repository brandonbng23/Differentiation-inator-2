# Differentiation-inator 2

## Critical Update - Aug 29, 2025

Busy summer! My aspirations were for Differentiation-inator 2.0 to be completed by summer's end. While, technically, summer isn't over, this deadline is no longer achievable. It has been a winding road--one I still haven't fully figured out--to make Differentiation-inator 2.0 work the way I'd like. As I continue to work, I am certain that, sooner rather than later, the initial release of Differentiation-inator 2.0 will be ready for launch. 

## Description

Differentiation-inator 2.0 is a second version web program that applies the mathemetical rules of differentiation to a function as inputted by its user. Differentiation-inator 2.0 is still in development. This repository will be updated as progress is made.

## Project Development

Differentiation-inator 2.0 is a personal project. It is modeled off a Differentiation-inator, which was created as a project to fulfill a course requirment. The requirements of the course project limited Differentiation-inator. Differentiation-inator 2.0 is being programmed without being held to these requirements to deliver a convenient, simple web application that can be used to find a function's derivative.
